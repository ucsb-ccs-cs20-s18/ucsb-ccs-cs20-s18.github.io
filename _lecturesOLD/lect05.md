# Some hints on how to get a good grade or a bad grade on lab01

* How to get a good grade

   * Carefully review the criteria on the [lab01 description](/lab/lab01/)
   * Make sure you are following all of those.

* How to get a bad grade
   * Not having TWO appearances of each letter and number at TWO different sizes (to illustrate that your function works as it should)
   
* Other ways to get a bad grade
   * Not using functions to draw the letters 
   * Having different functions that draw the same letter (reuse is the whole idea of functions!)   
   * Having functions "hard coded" points (specific places rather than points calculuated in terms of `startX`, `startY`, `width`, `height`
   
# More on pytest

When we write a function, we want to test whether the function works properly or not.

Doing that by hand is tedious.   We might start cutting corners.

So, it is good practice to automate that.  We'll show how that works.
