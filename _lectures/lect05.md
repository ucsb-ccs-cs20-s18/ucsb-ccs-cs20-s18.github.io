# Update on homework

I've updated the homework online, and provided places to submit all of the homeworks from h00 through h06 online.

I've set a schedule of "suggested" due dates that will get us caught up with the CS8 section.  If you want to take their first midterm as an optional 
take-home exam (on the honor system) to check your understanding of course concepts, this schedule will get you caught up in time to do that.

If you need more time (within reason, i.e. a few days), let me know, but I'd prefer not to extend those due dates much, so that this isn't hanging out as "unfinished business" for 
either of us.

# Various ways of running Python code

* From a file inside IDLE
* at IDLE `>>>` prompt
* From a file outside IDLE using `python3 file.py` or `python file.py`
* From a file outside IDLE in a shell, using a `shbang`
* Importing one file into another
* Using `python -i file.py` or `python3 -i file.py`

# lab03--more practice with function definitions and tests

Today, we'll start by working on lab03, which gives us more practice with writing function definitions and tests.
