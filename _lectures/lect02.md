# Python Dictionaries

In Python, we can use a *dictionary* to associate keys with values.

This code creates a simple dictionary called `en_to_es` (short for "English to EspaÃ±ol), that
maps the words `one`, `two` and `three` (as Python strings) to their Spanish counterparts (as
Python strings):

```python
en_to_es = { 'one' : 'uno', 'two' : 'dos', 'three' : 'tres' }
```

Once you create a dictionary, you can access the values by looking up their key.
Here, we show trying some Python dictionary code at the interactive Python shell:

```python
>>> en_to_es = { 'one' : 'uno', 'two' : 'dos', 'three' : 'tres' }
>>> en_to_es['one']
'uno'
>>> en_to_es['three']
'tres'
>>> 
```
